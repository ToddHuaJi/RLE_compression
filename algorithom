Cycles:
initial =1
getdata =3
if same bit = +2
if different = +7

cases:

if only one segment need to calculate delays for recv_ready and end_of_stream
  cases: 
      last bit differs, +6 delay for end_of_stream and recv_read

if two segment and bits different need to calculate delay for recv_ready and end_of_stream go with second segment(no delay)

if two segment and bits same need to calculate delays for recv_ready and end_of_stream
